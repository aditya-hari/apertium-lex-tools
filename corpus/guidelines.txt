Sentence in the 'taxa' file that has more than one ambiguity, e.g. 
  - La taxa mitjana mensual registrat al març (de baix cabal mínim) és de 53 m³/segon
  - The monthly average rate registered in March (of low minimum flow) is of 53 m³/second
  
  'cabal' can be {discharge, flow} -- but the reference only has 'flow', but
  the file is about 'taxa', not about 'cabal'.
